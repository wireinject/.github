# wireinject

`wireinject/wire` is a community project dedicated to maintaining a runnable version of `google/wire`. 



## Motivation

The original `google/wire` repository has been archived by Google and is no longer maintained. This has led to a critical issue:

With upcoming Go releases (such as Go 1.25), attempting to install `wire` via `go install` fails due to an outdated dependency on `golang.org/x/tools`. The build fails with the following compile error: 

> [x/tools: v0.8.0 through v0.25.0 (Oct 2024) contain public packages that fail to build with Go 1.25.0 #74462](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/74462)

```
# golang.org/x/tools/internal/tokeninternal
.../go/pkg/mod/golang.org/x/tools@v0.17.0/internal/tokeninternal/tokeninternal.go:78:9: invalid array length -delta * delta (constant -256 of type int64)
```

This issue breaks CI/CD pipelines for any project that relies on `wire` for code generation once they upgrade their Go toolchain. To solve this problem, we created `wireinject/wire`.



## Our Goal

The objective of `wireinject/wire` is very specific and limited:

- **We do not aim to add any new features.**
- Our sole purpose is to **update dependencies with the minimum necessary changes to the `google/wire` source code,** ensuring that it compiles and runs correctly on modern Go toolchains.

We are committed to making this fork a stable and reliable drop-in replacement, allowing the community to continue using the `wire` tool seamlessly.



## How to Use

Migrating from the original `google/wire` is straightforward, and **no changes to your project's code are required**.

You simply need to replace the `wire` binary on your system with the version compiled from `wireinject/wire`.



#### Installation

Run the following command to install the patched `wire` tool:

```
go install github.com/wireinject/wire/cmd/wire@latest
```

After installation, ensure that the `wire` command in your `$PATH` points to the newly installed executable. You can verify this using the `which wire` command.



#### Compatibility Guarantee

The `wire_gen.go` file produced by `wireinject/wire` is **identical** to the file generated by the original `google/wire`. Your existing workflows will not be affected in any way.
